# HCA-uncovers-metastable-phenotypes-in-hEC-monolayers

This repository contains the scripts used in the paper ["High Content Analysis uncovers metastable phenotypes in human endothelial cell monolayers and key features across distinct populations"](incl. link to paper) for: 

- "Shiny App V1.2" contains the R scripts to reproduce the Shiny Application for interactive data selection 
 used to subset the database after tSNE clustering 
 
- "SLAS2_Stats_Notebook.Rmd" is an R notebook containing the scripts for reduction analysis and statistical analysis 

- "SLAS2 NotebookD1R3_4.Rmd" contains the R scripts for data visualisation

- Can also use this for pipeline upload stuff 

## ECPT
Endothelial Cell Profiling Tool (ECPT) expands on pervious work (which can be found [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2472555218820848))
### Requirements: 

### Useage: 
For a detailed description and step-by-step walk through of carrying out analysis using ECPT, refer to the [supplementary methods section](Link to appendix).   

## Shiny App
### Requirements: 
1. R and R studio Version 4.0.2. was used and is required for script useage 
2. Install CellProfiler? 

### Useage: 
- All scripts are written to run with the raw dataset, which can be found in the 'data' folder as 'XXX'
